# App Name?

Popular dating apps do not fully accomodate people with special needs.  Dating can be a difficult task for people with special needs so my app's purpose is to make that easier.

Special needs includes many different issues and each person can vary in severity.  Some people are fully independent, while others need caretakers.

In the case of mental disabilities, I plan to allow the caretaker to also make an account that can sign off on certian things.  Security of my users is my number one concern.

big stretch goals: 
- allow posting, commenting and liking, sharing photos
- have a small game where users can walk around and build 2d houses and entering the house would allow you to leave some kind of like or something.  Gameifying dating can take a lot of pressure off of the whole thing


as a user I want to:
  - set up my account
  - add caregiver
  - search potential matches, look at their bio and pics, like
  - chat with users that mutually liked
  - stretch: play a game with them
  - look at special needs resources
as a caregiver I want to:
  - view activity of user
  - sign off on certian things (a new match, a first date)
  - possibly more, I am talking to a few parties about what would be necassary but not invasive or demeaning

  This whole subject is tricky to talk about. I want it to be very positive experience.
